This repository contains examples that can be run on the GAP8 as well as some supporting
documentation for developing for the GAP8. The examples are a good starting point for
creating your own applications.

The examples in this repository rely on the fact that the
[Getting started with the AI deck tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-aideck/)
has been completed. This means that all the firmware is up to date,
the GAP8 bootloader has been flashed and the Crazyflie is used
to set up the WiFi on the ESP32 in access point mode.
