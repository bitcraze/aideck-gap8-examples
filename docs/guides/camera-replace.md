## Introduction
There are currently two versions of the Himax ULP camera used on the AI-deck. A [monochrome](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/accessories/products/ai-deck-monocrome-camera-module) and a [bayer-RGB](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/accessories/products/copy-of-ai-deck-color-camera-module). If you would like to switch the camera type or change it because it is broken these instructions will guide you though it.
